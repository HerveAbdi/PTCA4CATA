Description:
    PTCA4CATA is a collection of routines to
    1) analyze check all that apply (CATA) data
    with Partial Triadic Correspondence Analysis (PTCA),
     2) display the results graphically, and 3)
     perform the correct inferences.
         In addition to correspondence analysis, Hellinger analysis
         can also be used.
