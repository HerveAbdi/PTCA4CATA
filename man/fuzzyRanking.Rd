into a fuzzy code (a.k.a. doublings, or thermometer code).}
\usage{
fuzzyRanking(X, min = NULL, max = NULL, neg.mark = ".neg",
  pos.mark = ".pos")
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{an \eqn{I} by \eqn{J} matrix where
the rows are object or stimuli and the columns are variables.
At the intersection of a row and columns is the rating
for the object in the row for the variable in the column.}

\item{min}{(default = \code{NULL})
the minimum value(s) for the scale.
if \code{NULL} (default), the min is computed per column,
if \code{min} is a scalar it is used for all column,
if \code{min} is a vector of length \eqn{J} is is used per column.}

\item{max}{(default = NULL)
(default = \code{NULL}) the maximum value(s) for the scale.
if \code{NULL} (default), the max is computed per column,
if \code{max} is a scalar it is used for all column,
if \code{max} is a vector of length \eqn{J} is is used per column.}

\item{neg.mark}{(default = '.neg') the suffix for the negative
side of the scale.}

\item{pos.mark}{(default = '.pos')
 the suffix for the positive
side of the scale.}
}
\value{
a data frame (or a matrix)
}
\description{
\code{fuzzyRanking}:
recode a rank or Lickert type scale
into a fuzzy code (a.k.a. doublings, or thermometer coding).
\code{fuzzyRanking}: is used to recode rating scale data
prior to perform Multiplle Correspondence Analysis on
rating scale (e.g., Lickert scale).
}
\details{
Each column is recoded as two columns, The first one expressed
the distance to the negative pole of the scale and the second one
expressed the distance to the positive pole. For example for a 5 point
Lickert scale going from 1 to 5, a value of 2 will be recoded as
\eqn{d.neg} = 1/4 and \eqn{d.pos} = 3/4.
Note that \eqn{d.neg} and \eqn{d.pos} always sum to 1.

If \code{X} has no column names, the dimension will be named
\code{V1} to \code{VJ.}
