\title{recode rating data (e.g., Lickert type scale)
into a fuzzy code  (a.k.a. doubling, or thermometer code)
creating 2 columns
\emph{per} variable.}
\usage{
fuzzyRanking(X, min = NULL, max = NULL, neg.mark = ".neg", pos.mark = ".pos")
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{an \eqn{I} by \eqn{J} matrix where
the rows are objects or stimuli and the columns are variables.
At the intersection of a row and a column is the rating
for the object in the row for the variable in the column.}

\item{min}{(default = \code{NULL})
the minimum value(s) for the scale.
if \code{NULL} (default), the min is computed per column,
if \code{min} is a scalar it is used for all column,
if \code{min} is a vector of length \eqn{J},
 is is used for the columns.}

\item{max}{(default = NULL)
(default = \code{NULL}) the maximum value(s) for the scale.
if \code{NULL} (default), the max is computed per column,
if \code{max} is a scalar it is used for all column,
if \code{max} is a vector of length \eqn{J} is is used
for the columns.}

\item{neg.mark}{(default = '.neg') the suffix for the negative
side of the scale.}

\item{pos.mark}{(default = '.pos')
 the suffix for the positive
side of the scale.}
}
\value{
a data frame (or a matrix).
}
\description{
\code{fuzzyRanking}:
recodes a rank or Lickert type scale
into a fuzzy code (a.k.a. doubling, or thermometer coding).
\code{fuzzyRanking} is used to recode rating scale data
prior to performing Multiplle Correspondence Analysis on
this type of data.
}
\details{
Each column is recoded as two columns: The first one expresses
the distance to the negative pole of the scale and the second one
expresses the distance to the positive pole. For example for a 5 point
Lickert scale going from 1 to 5, a value of 2 will be recoded as
\eqn{d.neg} = 1/4 and \eqn{d.pos} = 3/4.
Note that \eqn{d.neg} and \eqn{d.pos} always sum to 1.

If \code{X} has no column names, the columns will be named
\code{V1} to \code{VJ} in the output.
