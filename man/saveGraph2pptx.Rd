\usage{
saveGraph2pptx(file2Save.pptx, title = NULL, addGraphNames = FALSE)

\item{file2Save.pptx}{the name of the PowerPoint
file for saving the graphs. If this file already exists,
the old file is renamed and a warning message is printed
in the console.}

\item{title}{main title of the PowerPoint file.

a list (of class \code{"savePptx"})
with  \code{listOfsavedGraphs} (the list of the graph objects
saved)  and
\code{nameOfSavingFile4pptx} (name of the files where
the graphics are saved).
Note: to print one of the graphs from
\code{nameOfSavingFile4pptx}, use
\code{print(get())}. For example,
to print the first graph of the list
saved as \code{listOfGraph} use
\code{print(get(listOfGraph$listOfsavedGraphs[[1]]))}.
